# Datalogger-ESP32-RTC-SD
This repository is made for people who want to use any ESP32 datalogging capabilities.

Hardware:

It has been tested with Adafruit gear: Feather Huzzah32 and the feather datalogging shield (SD+RTC)

Code:

The code in this repo has been developped and tested in Arduino 1.8.13 with the latest arduino libraries (as for 2021/04/28). Win 10 64bit.

This repository is made so that you can do 2 things: set the RTC clock to the correct date and time + use the datalogging capabilities.

The setting of the RTC is heavily based on an existing code for ESP8266 (<insert source>). 

PS: I might add the Matlab code here to parse the data.


I hope this is going to help you.

Enjoy!
